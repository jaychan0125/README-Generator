## Description 
🦝🦝🦝 Hello! Welcome to my readme generator! Please answer the prompts, and a readme will be generated for you! Yay!! 🦝🦝🦝

**[Video Walkthrough](-add link later-)**

For this challenge, we had some starter code and instructuions asking us to use the npm inquirer to create prompts to help us generate a README.md! You'll be prompted to answer some questions like: the title of the project, description, installation instructions, how one would use the application, who the contributors to the project are and what email to contact for questions, how one would test the project, and which license you'd like to use. By answering these quetions, the input data is taken and written into a new README.md file!!
